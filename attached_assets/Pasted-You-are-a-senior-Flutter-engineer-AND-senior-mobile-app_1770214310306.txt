You are a senior Flutter engineer AND senior mobile app designer.

Context:
You already implemented the new structure and it builds:
- lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart (design system)
- lib/features/onboarding/ (4-step onboarding)
- lib/features/shell/ (bottom nav with 5 tabs)
- “Home tab” screen with the 3 core actions (View Slots, Write URL, Clear URL)
- placeholder tabs for Wristbands, Teams, Analytics, Account
- onboardingComplete gating persisted (first login only)

The flow and routing are DONE.
Now we do ONE thing only: VISUAL DESIGN UPGRADE to premium WOW mobile app.

Absolute constraints:
1) DO NOT change logic, routing, onboarding gating, or any Firebase/Shopify/NFC handlers.
2) DO NOT refactor or move folders again.
3) DO NOT rename these core actions: View Slots, Write URL, Clear URL.
4) DO NOT touch Shopify webhooks configuration.
5) You must only restyle and improve UI/UX within the existing implemented screens.

Brand colors:
- Blue: #0075FD (primary)
- Orange: #F75013 (accent)
Use Blue for primary actions, Orange only as accent, highlights, destructive, and key badges.

Design direction (must follow):
Premium mobile SaaS + modern iOS/Android feel.
Not web form.
High contrast, clean spacing, soft depth, tasteful gradients, strong hierarchy.

DESIGN SYSTEM SPEC (implement in app_theme + reusable widgets):
A) Surfaces
- Background: very light gradient using blue tint (top) to white (bottom). Example: start with #EAF3FF at top, fade to #FFFFFF.
- Cards: pure white with soft shadow and large radius.
- Radius: 20 for main cards, 16 for inputs, 999 for pill badges/buttons.
- Shadow: subtle but visible (two-layer shadow, low opacity). No harsh borders.

B) Typography
- Headline (screen title): 28-32, bold, near-black (#0B1220).
- Subtitle/description: 14-16, medium, cool gray (#5B677A).
- Section labels: 12-13 uppercase or semibold, gray (#6B7688).
- Input text: 16.
- Button text: 16-17 semibold.

C) Buttons
- Primary button: FULL WIDTH, height 52-56, pill radius 999, solid Blue #0075FD, white text, subtle shadow.
- Secondary button: outline Blue, transparent background, same height/radius.
- Destructive button: Orange background OR orange outline (depending on context). Never purple.
- Add buttons: use Blue outline with plus icon in Blue.
- Disabled states: reduce opacity and remove shadow.

D) Inputs
- Use filled input style (light fill #F4F7FB) with Blue focus border.
- Label above input (not placeholder-only).
- Helper text smaller, gray.
- Error text in Orange, with small icon.

E) Components to create (if not already):
- BrandedHeader (logo centered, bigger)
- StepPill (top right, “Step X of 4”)
- OnboardingCard (centered card container)
- PrimaryCTA / SecondaryCTA
- InfoBanner (for NFC not available)
- StatCard (for Home tab summary cards)
- ActionTile (for View Slots, Write URL, Clear URL)

SCREEN-BY-SCREEN UI REQUIREMENTS

1) ONBOARDING Step screens (keep ALL titles/descriptions EXACTLY as now)
Layout:
- Full screen gradient background.
- Top area: centered big logo (not tiny, not left with black text). Logo should be the primary brand element.
- Under logo: the main card centered with max width for web preview but designed mobile-first.
- Step pill: top right floating pill inside safe area (Blue outline or light blue fill), not huge.
- Card contains:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Form fields
  - CTA row (Back on left for steps 2-4, Next on right), or single Next full width on step 1.

Step 1 of 4: Welcome & Initial Setup
- Make it feel like a premium welcome screen.
- “Next” must be Blue primary, full width on mobile.
- The “slot count” field should look read-only if it is read-only (lock icon or subtle “auto” helper).

Step 2 of 4: Define Your Wristbands
- Each wristband row must be a mini-card or rounded field row:
  - left: input
  - right: remove icon button (Orange outline, circular)
- “Add Another Wristband” must look like a premium add action:
  - full width outline button, Blue border, plus icon, slight hover/press animation.

Step 3 of 4: Define Your Teams and Members
- Each team should appear as a card section with:
  - Team name input
  - Members list
  - Add member button (outline Blue)
- Make scrolling comfortable and avoid giant empty space.
- Keep the suggestion box but style it as an InfoBanner (light blue background, blue icon).

Step 4 of 4: Assign Wristbands & Set Profile URL
- GBP URL input at top.
- Assign list: each wristband row as a card row:
  - left: wristband name
  - right: dropdown pill
- Warning “unassigned” must be a styled warning banner (light orange background, orange icon).
- Final CTA: Blue primary, label must be premium (“Finish Setup” or “Go to Dashboard”). Not “Start Simulation”.

2) HOME TAB (this is the new main screen after onboardingComplete)
Important: This is NOT “old dashboard”. This is the Home tab you already created.
Restyle it to premium:
Top:
- big centered logo or branded header, optional small greeting text.
- show NFC info banner only when needed, styled premium.
Middle:
- 2-3 StatCards (Plan status, Available slots, Purchased total). Use icons, soft shadows, clean numbers.
Bottom:
- Three ActionTiles or big buttons for:
  - View Slots (neutral dark card with blue accent)
  - Write URL (primary Blue)
  - Clear URL (Orange accent, destructive style)
They must look like premium app controls, not three plain web buttons.

3) Bottom Navigation
- Must be clean, modern, with correct spacing.
- Active icon/label in Blue, inactive in gray.
- No burger menu anywhere.

4) Placeholders (Wristbands, Teams, Analytics, Account)
- Each should look like a real premium page shell:
  - header, icon, “Coming soon” style content
  - consistent spacing, not blank white pages.

DO NOT DO:
- No purple anywhere.
- No tiny logo in corner with black “Reviews Everywhere” text.
- No web-form look.
- No re-architecture, no new flows, no rewriting logic.

Acceptance check:
- After restyle, run and confirm:
  - onboarding still only first login
  - subsequent logins go to Home tab
  - View Slots, Write URL, Clear URL still work exactly
  - colors are strictly #0075FD and #F75013 based, no purple

Deliver output:
- Commit only theme + widget style changes and screen layout polish.
- Do not change business logic.
```

NO restructuring. Style-only pass. Do not move files. Do not change routing or logic.
