You are a senior Flutter engineer and senior mobile app designer working on this project.

Context (do NOT change or break this):
- Login (email/password) is already implemented and working.
- Shopify webhooks, entitlement logic, and Firebase data are already implemented and working.
- Core post-login functions already exist and MUST remain unchanged:
  - View Slots
  - Write URL
  - Clear URL
- These functions were previously accessible from the old UI and are now reused in the new flow.

Goal:
- The new 4-step onboarding UI has already been created.
- Now you must CONNECT Step 1 of onboarding to EXISTING DATA instead of leaving it empty.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT – STEP 1 PREFILL (MANDATORY):

Step 1: “Welcome & Initial Setup” has two fields:
1) Purchaser Name
2) Number of Initial Wristband Slots

These fields MUST be pre-filled automatically using the SAME existing logic and data source that was previously shown when the user clicked “View Slots” in the old UI.

Rules:
- Do NOT invent new backend logic.
- Do NOT hardcode values.
- Reuse the existing data already fetched from Firebase / Shopify entitlements.
- If the data already exists in memory or state after login, reuse it.
- If it is fetched via an existing provider, service, or controller, reuse it.
- Do NOT add new API calls unless strictly necessary.

Behavior:
- On entering Step 1:
  - Purchaser Name field is auto-filled with the purchaser/customer name associated with the logged-in Shopify account.
  - Number of Initial Wristband Slots is auto-filled with the total number of wristbands purchased (entitlement count).
- Both fields MUST remain editable by the user.
  - Example behavior: if the user purchased 10 wristbands, the field shows 10 by default, but the user may change it to a lower number to start with fewer assignments.
- Validation rules already implemented must still apply after editing.

Important:
- This onboarding happens AFTER login, not before.
- Do NOT add any purchase checks here (purchase validation already happened earlier in the flow).
- This step is purely about displaying and editing already-known data.

Implementation guidance:
- Identify where the existing “View Slots” data is sourced from.
- Extract or reuse that same data model/service/state.
- Inject it into the onboarding Step 1 form as initial values.
- Ensure updates in Step 1 correctly propagate to Step 2 logic (wristband count sync).

Do NOT modify:
- Shopify webhooks
- Entitlement calculations
- NFC logic
- Slot enforcement logic beyond syncing counts correctly

Final check:
- Step 1 shows real purchaser name and real purchased slot count on first render.
- User can edit both values.
- Changing slot count correctly limits Step 2 wristband creation.
- No regressions in existing functionality.
