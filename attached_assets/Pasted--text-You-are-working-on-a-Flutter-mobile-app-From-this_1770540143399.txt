You are working on a Flutter mobile app. From this point, assume the DASHBOARD does NOT exist yet and must be built from scratch (code + design). You must NOT delete, remove, or break anything that already works today (auth, routing, onboarding, backend, entitlements). Do NOT refactor unrelated code. Add new code cleanly and safely.

ABSOLUTE PRIORITIES
1) Create a NEW Dashboard screen as the post-login landing screen, built from zero UI, following the brand identity and design system below.
2) Implement a first-time-only onboarding tooltip tour (11 steps) shown over the dashboard with a dark overlay and a centered modal card (same behavior as the screenshot).
3) Keep tooltip TEXT CONTENT exactly as provided by the prototype screenshots (text only). Do NOT copy prototype design. Our design system rules override.
4) At the very end, remove only the old temporary debug logs in the Cloud Function orderPaid that were used to verify bundle units. Do not change entitlement logic.

DO NOT
- Do not delete any existing files or screens.
- Do not remove any existing routes or flows.
- Do not rename existing classes/paths unless strictly necessary.
- Do not implement web-style UI.
- Do not invent tooltip text. Use exactly what is provided.
- Do not change entitlements math, refunds logic, or Shopify webhook behavior (except removing old temporary debug logs at the end).

BRAND COLORS
- Primary Blue: #0075FD
- Accent Orange: #F75013
Rules:
- Blue for primary actions.
- Orange only for accents, highlights, destructive states, and key badges.
- Never use purple.

DESIGN DIRECTION
Premium mobile SaaS + modern iOS/Android feel.
High contrast, clean spacing, soft depth, tasteful gradients, strong hierarchy.

DESIGN SYSTEM SPEC (implement in a dedicated theme file + reusable widgets, without breaking current app theme)
A) Surfaces
- App background: very light gradient, top #EAF3FF fading to #FFFFFF bottom.
- Cards: pure white, soft shadow, large radius.
- Radii: 20 for main cards, 16 for inputs, 999 for pill badges/buttons.
- Shadows: subtle but visible, two-layer, low opacity. No harsh borders.

B) Typography
- Screen title: 28-32, bold, near-black #0B1220.
- Subtitle: 14-16, medium, cool gray #5B677A.
- Section labels: 12-13, semibold or uppercase, gray #6B7688.
- Input text: 16.
- Button text: 16-17 semibold.

C) Buttons
- Primary: full width, height 52-56, radius 999, solid Blue, white text, subtle shadow.
- Secondary: outline Blue, transparent bg, same height/radius.
- Destructive: Orange background or Orange outline depending context.
- Add buttons: Blue outline with plus icon in Blue.
- Disabled: reduce opacity and remove shadow.

D) Inputs
- Filled input style: fill #F4F7FB, Blue focus border.
- Label above input (not placeholder-only).
- Helper text small gray.
- Error text Orange with small icon.

DATA (READ ONLY)
The dashboard reads the signed-in account document from Firestore (existing structure), including:
- displayName (or firstName fallback)
- slotsPurchasedTotal
- slotsUsed
- slotsAvailable
Do not change database structure. Only read and render.

DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS (V1)
Create a NEW dashboard screen with these sections (keep it clean and premium):
1) Header
- Large greeting title: “Hi, {name}”
- Small subtitle under it (short supportive line)
2) Slot summary card (main)
- Show slotsAvailable prominently (large number)
- Secondary row: Purchased, Used (and Refunded only if the field exists)
- Primary action button: “Add new wristband”
  - Visible only if slotsAvailable > 0
  - If slotsAvailable == 0: hide the button and show an orange pill badge: “No slots available, buy more”
IMPORTANT about the button:
- If an existing onboarding flow for adding a wristband already exists and is safe to reuse, wire it.
- If it does NOT exist yet, wire the button to a safe placeholder route/screen that simply says “Coming soon” (premium styled), so we do not break the app. Do NOT implement the whole add-wristband logic in this prompt unless it is already present and stable.
3) Recent activity card (placeholder, no fake data)
- Title: “Recent activity”
- If no data source exists, show a clean empty state message.
4) Support card
- One simple action button (stub is OK): “Contact support”

ROUTING
- After successful login, navigate to this NEW Dashboard screen.
- Do not remove or replace any existing screens. Add the dashboard route and update only the post-login destination safely.

FIRST-TIME TOOLTIP TOUR (11 steps)
Behavior:
- Show ONLY on the first dashboard open (per device).
- Dark overlay covers the dashboard behind it (opacity ~0.55-0.65).
- Centered modal card with:
  - Title
  - Body
  - Progress “1 / 11”
  - Primary button “Next” (last step: “Finish”)
  - Close “X” top-right
- Next advances steps.
- Close or Finish marks tour as completed and never shows again.
Persistence:
- Use SharedPreferences (or existing local storage in the app) to store a boolean like “dashboardTourCompleted=true”.

TEXT SOURCE
- I will upload 11 tooltip screenshots.
- Extract the text exactly and implement the 11 steps accordingly.
- Implement the tour system now using a single centralized list (one file) so swapping the placeholder strings for final text is trivial.
- As soon as the 11 screenshots are available in the project, replace placeholders with exact text.

REUSABLE UI COMPONENTS (NEW, DO NOT BREAK EXISTING)
Create new reusable widgets/files (do not rewrite existing ones):
- GradientBackgroundScaffold
- PremiumCard
- PrimaryButton / SecondaryButton
- PillBadge
- PremiumTourModal (modal card for the tooltip)
Use the design system values above.

DELIVERABLE
- Provide full-file replacements for every file you change.
- List all changed/new files.

FINAL STEP: REMOVE OLD TEMP DEBUG LOGS (BACKEND, DO NOT CHANGE LOGIC)
After the dashboard + tour are done:
- In the Cloud Function that handles order paid (orderPaid handler), remove ONLY the old temporary debug logs that print per-line-item details like:
  “[orderPaid] lineItem: title=..., variant=..., qty=..., unitsPerBundle=..., units=...”
- Keep the final summary log line (orderId/customerId/totalUnits) if it is still useful, and keep error logs.
- Do not change entitlement calculations, fallbacks, refunds behavior, or any mapping logic.

QUALITY BAR
This must look and feel like a premium mobile app. Strong spacing, clean hierarchy, soft depth. No clutter. No web form look.
