You are a senior engeneer of fluttern, and you are working inside an existing Flutter app. Implement ONLY this feature and do not change anything else.

GOAL
Add an “Add new wristband” button in the dashboard that is visible ONLY when the current user has slotsAvailable > 0. When the user completes the existing onboarding flow for one wristband, increment slotsUsed by 1 in Firestore. Do NOT use Shopify order numbers for mapping. Do NOT touch entitlements, webhooks, refunds, or cloud functions.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Dashboard UI
- Read the current user document (same source already used for slotsPurchasedTotal, slotsUsed, slotsAvailable or similar).
- If slotsAvailable > 0:
  - Show a clear primary button labeled exactly: Add new wristband
- If slotsAvailable == 0:
  - Do NOT show the button.
  - Show a short message: No slots available, buy more

2) Start flow
- On button tap, start the EXISTING onboarding flow used to create/map a wristband.
- Reuse the same screens and logic, do not create a second onboarding or a new separate flow.
- The flow must create exactly ONE new wristband asset.

3) Slot consumption
- When the onboarding flow finishes successfully (wristband asset created/mapped and saved):
  - Update Firestore for the current user:
    - slotsUsed = slotsUsed + 1
  - Use an atomic increment (transaction or FieldValue.increment(1)) to avoid race conditions.
- If the flow is cancelled or fails:
  - Do not increment slotsUsed.

4) Data integrity and scope
- Do not rely on order number, order id, line item id, or variant info for this feature.
- Do not change how slotsPurchasedTotal is calculated.
- Only read slotsAvailable and write slotsUsed.

DELIVERABLE
- Provide a full-file replacement for each file you modify (no partial snippets).
- List the filenames you changed.
- Include a short manual test checklist:
  - slotsAvailable > 0 shows the button
  - completing onboarding increments slotsUsed by 1
  - slotsAvailable decreases by 1 accordingly in UI
  - cancelling does not change slotsUsed

IMPORTANT
- Keep all existing styles and navigation patterns.
- Do not add debug UI.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
