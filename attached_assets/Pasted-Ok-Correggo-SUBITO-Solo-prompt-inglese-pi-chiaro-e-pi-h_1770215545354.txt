Ok. Correggo SUBITO. Solo prompt, inglese, più chiaro e più “hard”.

```text
You are a SENIOR Flutter engineer AND a SENIOR mobile app designer.

CONTEXT (READ FIRST):
- The 4-step onboarding flow ALREADY EXISTS and IS WORKING.
- All logic, routing, Firestore writes, add/remove actions, and validation are already implemented.
- DO NOT change logic, step order, fields, or data handling.
- Your task is DESIGN ONLY: a FULL VISUAL OVERHAUL of the existing onboarding UI.

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS:
1) KEEP all onboarding titles, descriptions, labels, and step names EXACTLY as they are.
2) KEEP the 4 steps exactly as they are (Step 1 to Step 4).
3) DO NOT add or remove fields.
4) DO NOT change buttons behavior or routing.
5) DO NOT touch backend, Firebase, or Shopify webhooks.

BRAND IDENTITY (MANDATORY):
- Primary Blue: #0075FD
- Primary Orange: #F75013
- Clean white base, premium SaaS mobile style
- NO purple, NO default Material look

TYPOGRAPHY (MANDATORY):
- Headings, titles, section headers:
  Raleway, weight 700
- Buttons and CTAs:
  Montserrat, weight 400
- Body text: modern sans, clean, readable, premium spacing

LOGO (MANDATORY, VERY SPECIFIC):
- Make the logo BIG and prominent.
- Target: logo width about 180 to 240 px on mobile (or visually equivalent), not tiny.
- Place it centered at the top as a hero brand element.
- DO NOT add “Reviews Everywhere” black text next to it.
- The top header must feel like a real premium app brand, not a website navbar.

STEP INDICATOR (MANDATORY, FOR ALL STEPS):
- The step indicator must ALWAYS be a single-line pill/badge.
- It must show exactly:
  Step 1 of 4
  Step 2 of 4
  Step 3 of 4
  Step 4 of 4
- It must NEVER wrap to two lines.
- Ensure enough horizontal padding and min-width so it never breaks on any screen size.
- Place it top-right or top area, but always readable and premium.

DESIGN GOAL:
This must look like a PREMIUM, WOW mobile app.
Not a colored form.
Use:
- large rounded cards
- elegant shadows
- strong hierarchy
- generous spacing
- premium input fields (padding, rounded corners, subtle borders)
- high-quality primary CTA button (bold, full-width, blue)
- consistent spacing system (8/12/16/24/32)

PROTOTYPE IMAGES:
- Reference images exist:
  onboard1
  onboard2
  onboard3
  onboard4
- They define FLOW and COMPONENTS ONLY.
- DO NOT copy their visual style.
- Your design must be clearly more premium than those references.

QUALITY BAR (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
If the result still looks like a basic web form with colors, it is FAILED.
Proceed with a DESIGN-ONLY overhaul of the existing 4 onboarding screens.
Do not change logic, only UI.
